f3-lib
======
A library for the F3 framework

### Getting Started

Clone the repo into a 'dsc' folder somewhere in your F3 project. Ensure that the 'dsc' folder's parent is added to your autoloader.  e.g., if you have /lib/ added to your autoloader, clone this repo into /lib/dsc/

### Dependencies

The library depends on several classes from https://github.com/joomla/joomla-framework
Add the Joomla Framework to your composer.json, use vendor/autoload.php, and move on.
